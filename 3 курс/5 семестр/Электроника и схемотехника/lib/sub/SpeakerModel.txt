Are you interested in simulating speakers?

Manufacturers sometimes give some basic info about the driver's physical 
characteristics that can be useful to start the modeling process, but my 
example was taken from my work from a few years ago with a prototype 
subwoofer that I was then developing.  

One gets in the ballpark by starting with the parameters from any model 
of a vaguely similar speaker, or by calculating the first cut parameters 
from the equations.  After that, it is not too much trouble through 
trial and error to adjust the parameters to get a near perfect fit to 
measurements.

I measured the proto subwoofer's impedance and response on an Audio 
Precision analyzer and I went looking for a way to model it so I could 
simulate an equalization scheme that uses positive feedback of coil 
current.  Almost all of the models I found were set in the acoustical-
mechanical domain and didn't capture actual performance all that well 
anyway.  So I came up with a much more EE friendly model to match the 
data. --  analog spiceman


Here is an example of a SPICE model that very accurately mimics 
measurement.  It is for a speaker with both an actively driven cone 
and a passive radiator cone.

First some definitions (skip to the end for a quick peak at the results).

  Bl    Electromechanical motor constant of the voice coil - this factor 
        depends on magnet strength, gap geometry and turns in the coil. 
        It relates coil displacement force to coil current (newtons/amp).

  Rvc   Rvc is the dc resistance of the voice coil.  Rvc1-3 account 
        for the frequency dependent increase in resistance due to eddy 
        current losses in the voice coil and surrounding pole pieces.

  Lvc   Voice coil inductance - decreases with increasing frequency due 
        to flux squeezing resulting from eddy currents.

  Les   Cone suspension compliance equivalent inductance:  Les = Cm*(Bl)^2
        Cm is the mechanical compliance in m/N.

  Cem   Cone mass equivalent capacitance:  Cem = Mm/(Bl)^2
        Mm is the mechanical mass in kg.

  Res   Cone suspension loss equivalent resistance:  Res = (Bl)^2/Lm
        Lm is the mechanical losses in inverse seconds.

  Fa    Acoustic output factor - goes up with cone area and motor 
        efficiency and goes down with cone mass, but has almost no 
        effect on electrical impedance. 

Note: RLesa and RLesp are added to avoid convergence problems with 
SPICE and Ro allows summing the current dependent current sources 
that model the acoustic output factor of the two cones in the system.
